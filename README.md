Some Basic Coding Problems - Python
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 1 - Sum of Digits of a Number
The first beginner problem that you come across when you start programming is the sum of the digits of a number. 
Generally we follow the route using For Loop and iterating over the number(by converting that into a string). Undoubtly you will get the correct answer but this is not the logical way of doing it because this does not help you think mathematically.

Problem 2 - Solution to HackerRank Any and All (Python Basic)
You are given a space separated list of integers. If all the integers are positive, then you need to check if any integer is a palindromic integer. If yes you need to print True else False. I have tried using simple logic by reversing a number using slicing format. However, you can write your piece of code to reverse the number and execute the code.
